# CrapsSimulation
A mini program that runs a basic generic game of Craps. Results are recorded in a text file.

This is a Craps Simulation game.In this game the user inputs the number of simulation they want run.
The program will run upto 100 simulations.The maximum value can be edited in the upDownValue properties
if the user wants to run more simulations.
The program then runs, recording each games:
-Dice value of die 1 and die 2
-Sum of both dices
-Whether or not Passing bet or don't pass bet won
-The loss of both bets if dices rolls a 12 

This program is very basic. It only does not ask for $$ or who you bet on. 
If the dice rolls a:

7/11 -- Passer bet wins
2/3 -- Don't passer bet wins
12 -- Both betters lose
4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 -- Point is assigned --> If the dice rolls the point before a 7 the passer wins else the don't passer wins
